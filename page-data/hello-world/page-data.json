I am professional Android developer.\nI am going to create a dedicated <strong>About</strong> page with more information, but for now I think this is enough.</p>\n<h3>What this blog is about?</h3>\n<p>I don’t know yet. I think I’ll be posting about my work. But I could also post about some other life stuff. If this thing doesn’t sink, I plan to add Portfolio and CV sections. We’ll see.</p>\n<h3>Why do I need a blog?</h3>\n<p>I had a Wordpress blog 6 years ago but somehow abandoned. Although at times it took quite a bit of effort to publish articles, I have to admit that the result was quite rewarding. I did enjoy sharing my knowledge and based on comments I received to my old blog, it really hepled some people.</p>\n<p>Of course there are other ways of sharing knowledge. But throughout my career of software engineer I realized that I don’t really enjoy making presentations. I usually work on something that I cannot open source on github. I don’t go on meet-ups…</p>\n<p>Sharing knowledge is not the only reason why one would want to maintain a blog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If blog focuses on professional matters, it complements the author’s resume. I think that having a blog definitely had some impact for me landing my first full-time job at a good company.</li>\n<li>Blogs help to organize your thoughts and can also be the channel to express one’s emotions freely.</li>\n<li>To a non-native speaker of English, writing a blog in this language helps to train their writing skills. I remember, I did start writing my blog in English for this very reason.</li>\n<li>And you can learn (or reinforce) a bunch of other stuff too. Like HTML/CSS, JavaScript and some other technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why not to use blogging platform?</h3>\n<p>I had experience with WordPress and I can’t complain – everything worked. I’ve also tried to publish a couple of articles on Medium – not problem with that as well. My main motivation of starting a self hosted static blog is to learn some new things in modern web development.</p>\n<p>I realized that over past 8 years since I did anything for web, the technologies have made a huge step forward. There is a lot to catch up with and honestly it’s a bit overwhelming. I will have to make myself not try to eat the whole thing and split the process in bite-sized pieces. So, what do I plan to learn with this new blog?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First of all, I will need to host this blog somewhere. I don’t really wanna have my own domain or hosting server at this point. The first thing that comes to my mind is Github Pages. So, if you are reading this in 2021, this is probably where it is hosted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I will also have to dive into this static web-site development thing and Gatsby.js in particular. Right now, a lot is like magic to me. As I add features and improve the design, I will have to learn some java script and CSS. So, this website will be my main playground.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hopefully, I will be able to add content regularly, and because of that I will need to automate the deployment process. It’s probably going to be a simple bash script at first. Then I would need to wrap it into a docker image to make the scrip platform-independed. This will enable me to deploy the website by the click of a button on Github Actions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ll be posting my journey through these steps in this blog. Stay tuned.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First blog post","date":"September 18, 2021","updated":"September 18, 2021","description":"Starting a self hosted blog based on Gatsby."}},"previous":null,"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"a7a4d95e-f3cb-5d16-857b-8d19d6c8f8ae","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":null}},
